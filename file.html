            <p><h4>Belief</h4>
            <p>
                It is often objected that knowledge cannot be a kind of belief, even though they can have the same objects, because they exclude each other. If I know that p, it would be wrong for me to say that I believe it, since this would suggest that I do not know it. If, knowing p, I am asked "Do you believe that p ?," I should reply "No, 1 know it." This is hardly a serious argument. I should mislead people if I described my wife as the woman I live with, and I might say, "No, she's my wife," if I were asked whether she is the woman I live with. Nevertheless, my wife is the woman I live with. What is true is that I do not merely live with her. Likewise, if I know that p, I do not merely believe it, but I do believe it all the same. It is often wrong or misleading in certain circumstances to say something that is unquestionably true. The boy who, having taken two jam tarts, answers the question "How many have you had?" by saying "One" has told the truth but not the whole truth.

                A more powerful argument against the definition of knowledge in terms of belief is that people can, it seems, know something to be the case and yet refuse, or be unable to bring themselves, to believe it. A woman told by wholly reliable witnesses with a wealth of circumstantial detail that her husband has been killed in an accident might be in this position. One way of getting around this objection is to say that she believes both that her husband is dead and that he is not. It is possible and not uncommon to believe something and its contradictory. It is not possible both to believe something and to not believe it at the same time, and what she will say is, "I don't believe it," although what she means is that she believes it is false. Another possibility is to say that although she has conclusive grounds for believing that her husband is dead, she does not, in fact, believe it and does not know it either. To have conclusive grounds is one thing; to recognize that they are conclusive is another.
                
                It should be noted that where knowledge and belief overlap, the kind of knowledge involved is propositional knowledge, or what Gilbert Ryle called "knowing that." There is also "knowing how" (to skate, tie a reef knot, do long division), where there are no propositions to be true or false and where knowledge can vary in degree. The two kinds of knowledge are connected in that both are the outcome of learning. Belief is always propositional or believing that; there is no believing how that serves as a defective version of knowing how to do something.

          <h4>information</h4>
           <p> Information originated from the Latin verb ‚ÄúInformare‚Äù (to inform) in the sense of ‚Äúto give form to the mind‚Äù, ‚Äúto discipline‚Äù, ‚Äúinstruct‚Äù, ‚Äúteach‚Äù.
            Information shortened as info is that which informs.
            Information is a short and logical description of anything.
            It describes the meaning, concept, and distinguishing properties of any subject, object, or thing.
            The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts.
            Information consists of facts and data organized to describe a situation or condition.
            Information is raw. It is just facts, concept,s or meaning. It is not acted upon by any receiver.
            Information is made up of ordered facts and data to explain a circumstance or condition. For example, while filling an application form of any institute you must fill in the information about yourself like your name, age address, etc.
            The figure given below shows how raw data is processed and filtered into information.
            
            
            When the data is processed into information, it doesn't have any irrelevant data. It includes data that has meaning, significance, and intent.
            It also involves the manipulation of source data, which becomes knowledge after the processing.
        </p>
    <h4>Understanding</h4><p>
        Understanding is a psychological process related to an abstract or physical object, such as a person, situation, or message whereby one is able to use concepts to model that object. Understanding is a relation between the knower and an object of understanding. Understanding implies abilities and dispositions with respect to an object of knowledge that are sufficient to support intelligent behavior.

Understanding is often, though not always, related to learning concepts, and sometimes also the theory or theories associated with those concepts. However, a person may have a good ability to predict the behavior of an object, animal or system‚Äîand therefore may, in some sense, understand it‚Äîwithout necessarily being familiar with the concepts or theories associated with that object, animal, or system in their culture. They may have developed their own distinct concepts and theories, which may be equivalent, better or worse than the recognized standard concepts and theories of their culture. Thus, understanding is correlated with the ability to make inferences.
Understanding could therefore be less demanding than knowledge, because it seems that someone can have understanding of a subject even though they might have been mistaken about that subject. But it is more demanding in that it requires that the internal connections among ones' beliefs actually be ‚Äúseen‚Äù or ‚Äúgrasped‚Äù by the person doing the understanding when found at a deeper level. 

Explanatory realism and the propositional model suggests understanding comes from causal propositions  but, it has been argued that knowing how the cause might bring an effect is understanding.  As understanding is not directed towards a discrete proposition, but involves grasping relations of parts to other parts and perhaps the relations of part to wholes.  The relationships grasped helps understanding, but the relationships aren't always causal.  So understanding could therefore be expressed by knowledge of dependencies.

            <h2>Gender School and Society</h2>
            <b>Gender Sexuality Patriarchy Masculinity And Faminiy</b>
            <h4>Gender</h4><p>
                The concept of gender in feminist writings and other
sociological discourses became popular in the early 1970. In
simple terms, gender explain the differences between men and
women in social terms as men, and as what a man can do; as
‚Äûwoman‚Äü, and as what a woman can or cannot do. Therefore,
gender is a analytical category that is socially constructed to
differentiate the biological difference between men and women.
The term gender is also used to describe the differences in
behaviour between men and women which are described as
‚Äûmasculine‚Äü and ‚Äûfeminine‚Äü. Feminist writings focus on this aspect
and claim that these differences are not biological but are social
constructions of patriarchal society.
Some theorists suggest that the biological differences
between men and women also result in their mental and physical
differences. They argue that biologically, men are physically and
mentally superior to women. Other theorists suggest that the
biological difference between men and women are exaggerated.
The differences are socially constructed by the patriarchal system
of society by which men are described as superior to women.
Therefore women become subordinate to men in the society.
Ann Oakley in her book, sex, gender and Society written in
1972 explores the term gender. Oakley says that in the Western
culture women play the roles of the ‚Äûhousewife‚Äü and ‚Äûmother‚Äü. This
is because women are made to play these roles because of their
biology. The western culture also believes that any effort to change
the traditional roles of men and women in the society can cause
damage to the social fabric of the society. Oakley concludes that
this view regarding the roles of men and women helps to support
and maintain the patriarchal society.
Simone de Beauvior in her book ‚ÄûThe Second Sex‚Äü says that
‚Äúone is not born, but rather becomes a woman‚Äù. She explains that
gender differences in the society make the man superior through
his role as the bread winner. It gives him a position of power in the
society and family. Gender differences are set in hierarchal
opposition such that men are superior and women are subordinate.
Women‚Äüs position is that of the ‚Äûother‚Äü and women are the continual
outsiders. Civilization was masculine to its very depth.
5
Shulamith Firestone in her book, ‚ÄûThe Dialectics of Sex
(1970) suggests that patriarchy exploits women‚Äüs biological
capacity to reproduce as their essential weakness. She explains
that the only way for women to break away from this oppression is
to use technological advances of free themselves from the burden
of childbirth. She advocated breaking down the biological bond
between mothers and children by establishing communes where
monogamy and nuclear family do not exist.
Few feminists accept firestones views mainly because both
technology and its uses are still firmly in the hands of men. While
cultural feminists question whether all the key differences between
men and women are solely cultural and whether also biological.
These feminists prefer to value and celebrate the mothering role as
evidence of women‚Äüs natural disposition towards nurturance and
would not like to relinquish even if the could.
Ann Oakley says that there is a constant slippage between
sex and gender; for example people are generally asked to declare
their ‚Äûgender‚Äü instead of sex on an application form. In feminist
writings there are references to the close association of gender with
the biological or natural as inevitable. Recent writings on sex and
gender suggest that feminism has relied too much on the
polarization of sex and gender distinctions, showing that the
meanings attached to sex differences are themselves socially
constructed and changeable. It is dependent on the way we
understand them and attach different consequences to these
biological ‚Äûfacts‚Äü within our own cultural historical context. At the
same time there is an argument that biology does contribute to
some behavioural characteristics.
Movia Gatens states that evidence points ‚Äúthat the male
body and the female body have quite different social value and
significance and cannot but help have a marked effect on male and
female consciousness‚Äù. Certain bodily events have huge
significance especially of they occur only in one sex. She cites the
example of menstruation. She points that masculinity is not valued,
unless it is performed by biological male; hence the male body itself
is imbued in our culture with the mythology of supremacy of being
the human ‚Äûnorm‚Äü.
Judith Butler‚Äüs theorization about gender introduces the
notion of performativity, an idea that gender is involuntarily
‚Äûperformed‚Äü within the dominant discourses of heteroreality.
Butler‚Äüs conception of is perhaps most radical as she asserts that
all identity concept ‚Äûare in fact that effects of institutions‚Äü practices,
discourses with multiple and diffuse points of origin‚Äü. She further
states that ‚Äúsex / gender distinction suggests a radical discontinuity
between sexed bodies and culturally constructed gender‚Äù. This
6
approach questions the may we make constructing of gender
identity. Individual do tend to challenge the way discourses
establish and reinforce certain meanings and institutions such as
that of compulsory heterosexuality.
It is difficult to accept a rigid distinction between sex and
gender as either wholly biological or singularly cultural. There is a
constant shifts between conceptualizations of human beings as
controlled by either predominantly biological or social forces. The
debates on sex and gender will continue as same will argue in
favour of biological differences while other feminist writers will
favour the differences as socially constructed, supported by social
institutions like religion, caste, family marriage and so on. The
substantial shift in women‚Äüs lives and expectations since the 1960s
clearly explains that the category of feminine has been rather
elastic. Women‚Äüs roles and performances have changed drastically
over the past few decades which has added new dimensions to the
debates by feminists and other on sex / gender distinctions.


            </p>
            <h4>Sexuality</h4><p>
                In a very broad way, ‚Äûsexuality‚Äü refers to the biological and
                physiological differences between male and female sexuality. The term
                sexuality is a physical differentiation between the biological male and the
                biological female. Thus, when an infant is born, the infant comes to
                be labeled ‚Äúboy‚Äù or ‚Äúgirl‚Äù depending on their sexuality. The genital
                differences between male and female is the basis of such
                characterization. There is a biological difference between the
                sexualities and most people are born (expect for a few ambiguous
                cases) as one sexuality or another. However, it has been argued that
                having been born into one sexuality or another, individuals are then
                socialized according to specific gender expectations and roles.
                Biological males learn to take on masculine roles. They are
                socialized to think and act in masculine ways. Biological females
                learn to take on feminine roles. They are socialized to think and
                behave in feminine ways. As the feminist writer Simone de
                Behaviour puts it ‚Äûone is not born a man but becomes one‚Äü, ‚Äûone is
                not born a woman but becomes one‚Äü.
                3
                At birth, besides the basic biological differences in the
                genitals and reproductive organs, there is not much difference
                between the male child and the female child. Society makes the
                differences between boy and girl through gender constructions.
                The biological differences between the sexualityes does to some extent
                explain certain psychological and socially constructed differences.
                This view is criticized by some feminist writers like Judith Butler.
                Judith Butler argues that sexuality is natural and comes first.
                Gender is perceived as a secondary construct which is imposed
                over the top of this natural distinction. Viewed thus, Butler argues
                ‚Äûsexuality‚Äü itself becomes a social category. This means that the
                distinction between ‚Äûmale‚Äü and ‚Äûfemale‚Äü is a social distinction made
                by the society, that is, it is a social construction. It is a particular
                way of perceiving and dividing the differences between ‚Äûmale‚Äü,
                ‚Äûfemale‚Äü. Butler explains that ‚Äûsexuality‚Äü though seen as biological, is as
                much a product of society as it gender. So the term sexuality is also
                socially constructed.
                The scientific, biological meaning and definition of sexuality is an
                important source of explanation to point out the basic differences in
                sexuality. Butler‚Äüs concern is that ‚Äûbiology‚Äü itself, as a scientific discipline,
                is a social system of representation and more important there are a
                number of differences between human beings, but only some
                become a basis for dividing human beings into distinct types. In
                other words, even if we accept that there are basic differences
                between the ‚Äûsexualities‚Äü there is no logical or rational reason for use.
                This is the basis for dividing human beings into two groups or
                sexualityes.
                Judith Butler further explains ‚Äûsexuality‚Äü is not just an analytical
                category. It is a normative category as well. It stipulates what men
                and women are. It also stipulates what men and women ought to
                be. It formulates rules to regulate the behaviour of men and
                women. Butler concludes that sexuality is also a social category. There
                are some feminist writers who do not agree with Butler and regard
                ‚Äûsexuality‚Äü as basically biological in nature.
            </p>
            <h4>Patriarchy</h4><p>
                Patriarchy is a often used term in everyday conversation.
The question here is ‚Äúwhat is patriarchy?‚Äù In casual conversation,
whether in English or any other language the term implies ‚Äúmale
domination‚Äù, ‚Äúmale prejudice (against women)‚Äù, or more simply
‚Äúmale power‚Äù. Put simply, the term means ‚Äúthe absolute rule of the
father or the eldest male member over his family‚Äù. Patriarchy is
thus the rule of the father over all women in the family and also
over younger socially and economically subordinate males.
Literally, patriarchy means rule by the male head of a social unit
(like family, tribe). The patriarch is typically a societal elder who
has legitimate power over others in the social unit.
However, since the early twentieth century, feminist writers
have used the term patriarchy as a concept to refer to the social
system of masculine domination over women. Patriarchy has been
a fundamentally important concept in gender studies. Feminist
writers have developed a number of theories that aim to understand
the bases of women‚Äüs subordination to men.
The term patriarchy is not only a descriptive term that
explains how different societies construct male authority and power,
but also become an analytical category. This changes of the use of
the term patriarchy from a descriptive to an analytical category took
place in the 1970s, in a specific global historical context of feminist
political and intellectual culture. In the course of time this later led
to the development of the discipline of women‚Äüs studies or gender
studies, when women agitated for their rights. At the Universities
women demanded that their experiences and points of view be
taken seriously that patriarchy emerged as a way of both describing
and explaining the world. Since this time, patriarchy has been used
critically to explain the main components of authority and power in
any social system. Patriarchy automatically privileges men over
women such that women have little or no claims to material, sexual
and intellectual resources of the society. That is, in a patriarchal
society women have to struggle to be educated, to have property or
to make choices regarding marriage and other aspects of life. For
men, these resources are a matter of right and can make choices
that affect their lives.
Let us take some examples to clarify the way in which
patriarchy is evident in our daily life.
9
When a man raises his voice in the course of an argument
and insects on his point of view, without letting others especially
women get to utter a single word, his actions are likely to be
described as ‚Äúaggressively patriarchal‚Äù.
If a women complains of sexual harassment at her work
place, and all the men in her office deny that this could ever
happen. The reasoning of men can be described as being
‚Äútypically patriarchal‚Äù.
In public speeches that disclaim the subordination of women,
this decimal is described by the term ‚Äûpatriarchy‚Äü.
In a very general way ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù is a ‚Äûcatch‚Äü word that
describes the different ways in which society discriminates against
women. These examples explain the many different and subtle
ways through which patriarchy is expressed in the society.
Anglo ‚Äì European anthropologists, writing in the nineteenth
century, used the term widely. In their writings, ‚Äûpatriarchy‚Äü, usually
referred to a social system where men were family heads, descent
was through the father. Men alone were priests, and all laws and
norms were dictated by the male elders in the community. When
used in this sense, the term ‚Äûpatriarchy‚Äü is often contrasted with the
term ‚Äûmatriarchy‚Äü, which referred to social system where women
exercised political authority over men, or possessed decisive power
and exercised a measure of control over social relationships and
everyday life. In the evolution of society, matriarchy was usually
considered and earlier and more primitive stage of society, and
patriarchy on later and more advanced stage of society.
In contemporary discourses on gender, patriarchy is a
central concept that feminist writers have been grappling with to
explain differential positions of men and women in the society.
These writings view patriarchy as the subordination of women. The
patriarchal system provides self ‚Äì definitions and norms for women.
These social norms restrict the social roles of women as mothers
and wives. The patriarchal system also amply rewards all those
women who learn to passively their defined roles.
Both wifehood and motherhood become glorified in the
patriarchal system. These roles are granted social sanctions and at
the same time are also eulogized in local folk lore, in literature, and
religion so that women do actively engage themselves in playing
their social roles and thus themselves contributes and perpetuate
the patriarchal social order.
            </p>
            <h4>Masculinity and Faminity</h4><p>
                The sex / gender differences raises the issues of male ‚Äì
female; masculine and feminine, male associated with masculinity
and female with femininity. With each constructions the biological
differences between men and women get translated into social
terms and descriptions. Feminist writers argue that biological
differences get heightened through social descriptions of
masculinity and femininity.
Patters of differences by gender is seen when the character
is either masculine or feminine. For example, pink and blue are
gendered colours, former regarded as ‚Äûfeminine‚Äü and the latter as
masculine. Further to be ‚Äûstrong‚Äü and ‚Äûtough‚Äü is masculine. Being
‚Äûweak‚Äü and ‚Äûsoft‚Äü are associated with feminine character. There are
several other traits that are categorized as masculine and feminine.
Masculinity and femininity are concepts which signify the social
outcomes of being male or female the traits and characteristics
which describe men and women give men advantage over women.
Moira Gatens points masculinity is not valued unless
performed by biological male. Hence the male body is imbued in
our culture with certain traits that characterize maleness or
masculinity. Hence the human norm of male supremacy. Similarly
femininity is performed by the biological female. The female body
is in our culture is imbued with certain traits that characterize
female or femininity. According to Judith Butler any theorization
about gender introduces the notion or idea of performance of
gender in terms of masculinity and femininity. Thus performance of
gender becomes involuntary as gender gets internalized through
the socialization process within the dominant discourses of
patriarchy gender is performed at different levels within the family
and in the society. We socially enter into our gendered categories
of masculine and feminine right from birth.
The concepts of masculinity and femininity as need in
feminist discourses and writing to explain the differences between
men and women. Some argue that these differences are based in
their biology while others reject this argument and emphasize that
the differences are socially constructed. Therefore, the construction
of men and masculinity will accrue exclusively to the bodies of
males. The construction of women and femininity will accrue
exclusively to the bodies of females.
In contemporary writings there is a recognition that these
social categorization of masculinity and femininity are blurring.
There is a constant shift in the conceptualization of human beings
as controlled by wholly biological or social forces. Women‚Äüs
8
expectations have changed, women lives and roles have
broadened. This explain just how malleable the category of
femininity is.

            <h2>Assesment for Learning</h2>
            <p>
                <h4>Importance of Providing Meaningful Student Feedback</h4>
Feedback is any response regarding a student's performance or behavior. It can be verbal, written or gestural. The purpose of feedback in the assessment and learning process is to improve a student's performance - not put a damper on it.  It is essential that the process of providing feedback is a positive, or at least a neutral, learning experience for the student. Negative feedback can discourage student effort and achievement. Instructors have the distinct responsibility to nurture a student's learning and to provide feedback in such a manner that the student does not leave the classroom feeling defeated.
<h4>Characteristics of Effective Feedback
</h4>
Educative in Nature
Providing feedback means giving students an explanation of what they are doing correctly AND incorrectly, with the focus of the feedback on what the students is doing right. It is most productive to a student's learning when they are provided with an explanation as to what is accurate and inaccurate about their work. One technique is to use the concept of a ‚Äúfeedback sandwich‚Äù to guide your feedback: Compliment, Correct, Compliment.

Given In a Timely Manner
When student feedback is given immediately after showing proof of learning, the student responds and remembers the experience about what is being learned more positively. If we wait too long to give feedback, the student might not connect the feedback with the learning moment.

Sensitive to the Individual Needs of the Student
It is vital that we take into consideration each individual when giving student feedback. Our classrooms are full of diverse learners. Some students need to be nudged to achieve at a higher level and other needs to be handled gently so as not to discourage learning and damage self-esteem. 

Answers the 4 Questions
Studies of effective teaching and learning (Dinham, 2002, 2007a; 2007b) have shown that learners want to know where they stand in regards to their work. Providing answers to the following four questions on a regular basis will help provide quality student feedback. 

What can the student do?
What can't the student do?
How does the student's work compare with that of others?
How can the student do better?
Provides a Model or Example
Communicate with your students the purpose for an assessment and/or student feedback. Demonstrate to students what you are looking for by giving them an example of what an A+ paper looks like. Provide a contrast of what a C- paper looks like. This is especially important at the upper learning levels.

Suggestions for Effective and Efficient Grading Feedback
The most effective feedback is focused, clear, and considers motivation and learning, not justifying a grade or on copyediting. Below are suggested strategies for providing efficient & effective student feedback.

Use comments to teach rather than to justify the grade, focusing on what you'd most like students to address in future work. Link your comments and feedback to the goals for an assignment.
Plan early opportunities for students to get feedback on ways of thinking, writing, or problem solving that they will need later, so that they don't develop or repeat common errors. In-class active or collaborative learning exercises can be good moments to provide formative feedback in class, when students are practicing new skills or learning new concepts.
Avoid over-commenting or ‚Äúpicking apart‚Äù students' work.
In your final comments, ask questions that will guide further inquiry by students.
Think about alternatives to writing comments on every individual student's work. Provide feedback to the whole class orally and/or in a shared written document, or have the class read sample student work together to look for common themes or apply evaluation criteria.
The Three Feedback Questions (Hattie & Timperley 2007)
<br>=>
Where am I going? Knowing the end Goal! <br>

The first question relates to goals or Where am I going? While there is much research about the power of goals in the management and psychological literature, it is not as common in the education literature. When students understand their goals and what success at those goals look like, then the feedback is more powerful. Without them feedback is often confusing, disorienting, and interpreted as something about the student not their tasks or work. Most school age students' goals are more sport or social than academic and most academic goals relate more to completion of work, being on time, and trying harder than on the quality of the academic outcomes.

There are two major elements of goals ‚Äì these are challenge and commitment. Challenging goals relate to feedback in two major ways. First, they inform individuals ‚Äúas to what type or level of performance is to be attained so that they can direct and evaluate their actions and efforts accordingly. Feedback allows them to set reasonable goals and to track their performance in relation to their goals so that adjustments in effort, direction, and even strategy can be made as needed‚Äù (Locke & Latham, 1990, p. 23). These levels of attainment can be termed success criteria. These are goals without clarity as to when and how the student (and teacher) would know they were successful and are often too vague to serve the purpose of enhancing learning. Second, feedback allows students (and/or their teachers) to set further appropriately challenging goals as the previous ones are attained, thus establishing the conditions for ongoing learning. By having clear goals, students are more likely to attend to reducing the gap instead of overstating their current status, or claiming various attributions that reduce effort and engagement. Goal commitment, which refers to one's attachment or determination to reach a goal, has a direct and often secondary impact on goal performance.
<br>=>
How am I going?<br>

The second question is more related to progress feedback (How Am I Going?). This entails feedback (about past, present or how to progress) relative to the starting or finishing point and is often expressed in relation to some expected standard, to prior performance, and/or to success or failure on a specific part of the task. Feedback information about progress, about personal best performance, and comparative effects to other students can be most salient to this second question.
<br>=>
Where to next?<br>

The third question is more consequential ‚Äì Where to next? Such feedback can assist in choosing the next most appropriate challenges, more self-regulation over the learning process, greater fluency and automaticity, different strategies and processes to work on the tasks, deeper understanding, and more information about what is and what is not understood.

            <h2>Creating an Inclusive school</h2>
            <h4>RTE Act 2009</h4>
            <h6>The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education,
                2009
                </h6>
            <p>
                On Thursday, April 1st 2010, seventy three years since Mahatma
Gandhi gave the call for universal education in 1937; sixty three years
since independence; sixty years since the Constitution, instead of making
education a fundamental right made it part of the Directive Principles;
seventeen years since the Supreme Court in 1993 ruled on the right to
education; eight years after the 86th constitutional amendment was passed
by the Parliament in 2002 by inserting Article 21A making education a
fundamental right for children in the restricted age group of 6 to 14 years;
and six years after the draft bill was prepared by the CABE10 committee,
the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, came
into force. And India became one of 135 countries to make education a
fundamental right of every child. The Children's Right to Free and
Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (Act No. 35 of 2009) came into effect
in the whole of India except the state of Jammu and Kashmir from 1
April 2010.
In Vishwas Kumar and Another v. State of Uttarakhand and
Others11, Hon'ble Sudhanshu Dhulia, J. observed the importance of the
right to Education Act in the following words:
‚ÄúThis is so because now under Article 21A of the constitution
and the right to Education Act, it is not just a fundamental right
of children to get elementary education but this right has now
become a meaningful right for various reasons and more
particularly because children will be imparted elementary
education by qualified and trained teachers.‚Äù
                <h6>Salient features of the Act of 2009</h6>
                Preamble of the 2009 Act is as follows:
‚ÄúAn Act to provide for free and compulsory education to
all children of the age of six to fourteen years.‚Äù
The salient features of the Right of Children for Free and
Compulsory Education act are -
<br>=> Free and compulsory education to all children of India in the six to 14
age group;
<br>=> No child shall be held back, expelled, or required to pass a board
examination until completion of elementary education;
<br>=> A child above six years of age has not been admitted in any school or
though admitted, could not complete his or her elementary education,
then, he or she shall be admitted in a class appropriate to his or her
age; Provided that where a child is directly admitted in a class
appropriate to his or her age, then, he or she shall, in order to be at par
with others, have a right to receive special training, in such manner,
and within such time limits, as may be prescribed: Provided further
that a child so admitted to elementary education shall be entitled to
free education till completion of elementary education even after
fourteen years.
<br>=> Proof of age for admission: For the purposes of admission to elementary
education. The age of a child shall be determined on the basis of the
birth certificate issued in accordance with the provisions of the Births.
Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1856 or on the basis of such
other document, as may be prescribed. No child shall be denied
admission in a school for lack of age proof.
<br>=> A child who completes elementary education shall be awarded a
certificate;
<br>=> Calls for a fixed student-teacher ratio;
<br>=> Will apply to all of India except Jammu and Kashmir;
<br>=> Provides for 25 percent reservation for economically disadvantaged
communities in admission to Class One in all private schools;
<br>=> Mandates improvement in quality of education;
<br>=> School teachers will need adequate professional degree within five years
or else will lose job;
<br>=> School infrastructure (where there is problem) to be improved in three
years, else recognition cancelled;
<br>=> Financial burden will be shared between state and central government.
<h6>Validity of 25 percent reservation for Economically
    Weaker Section (EWS)</h6>
    Section 12 of RTE is one of the key provision, which mandates
25 percent reservation in unaided schools for children from economically
weaker section and disadvantaged groups.
In this context it is important to refer to the Statement of Objects
and Reasons (SOR) attached to the Right of Children to Free and
Compulsory Education Bill, 2008, which states:
‚ÄúThe Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
Education Bill, 2008, is anchored in the belief that the
values of equality, social justice and democracy and the
creation of a just and humane society can be achieved
only through provision of inclusive elementary education
to all. Provision of free and compulsory education of
satisfactory quality to children from disadvantaged and
weaker sections is, therefore, not merely the responsibility
of schools run or supported by the appropriate
Governments, but also of schools which are not dependent
on Government funds.‚Äù
The idea that schooling should act as a means of social cohesion
and inclusion is not new; it has been oft repeated. Inequitable and disparate
schooling reinforces existing social and economic hierarchies, and promotes
in the educated sections of society an indifference towards the plight of
the poor.
For children of socio-economically weaker backgrounds to feel at
home in private schools, it is necessary that they form a substantial
proportion or critical mass in the class they join. The relevant universe in
which the proportion needs to be considered is the class/section. It is for
this reason that the RTE Act provides for admission of 25% children from
disadvantaged groups and weaker sections in class I only. This implies
that these children cannot be pooled together in a separate section or
afternoon shift. Any arrangement which segregates, or treats these children
in a differentiated manner vis-a-vis the fee-paying children will be counterproductive.
The rationale for 25% lies in the fact that the composition of
caste/class indicated in the Census is fairly representative of the composition
of children who are seeking admission under this provision. As per Census
2001, SCs constitute 16.2%, and STs constitute 8.2% (total 24.4%) of the
population. Further, the Tendulkar Committee, set up by the Planning
Commission to measure poverty, has estimated the below poverty line
(BPL) population to be 37.2%. It is a fact that much of the population
that suffers economic deprivation also suffers from social disadvantage.
Thus, taken together, the figure of 25% for admission of children from
disadvantaged groups and weaker sections is considered reasonable. Any
lower proportion would jeopardize the long-term goal of the policy which
is to strengthen social cohesion and bring out the best human resource
potential inherent in our society as a whole. A smaller proportion would
serve only a token purpose, and it will run the serious risk of creating the
feeling of alienation among the children belonging to disadvantaged groups
and weaker sections. Their participation in classroom interaction will be
neither strong nor sufficiently manifest to enrich the overall experiential
learning taking place in any given subject area. Only a critical mass can
play such a role.
Society for Un-aided Private Schools of Rajasthan v. U.O.I.
& Anr12 and as many as 31 others petitioned the Supreme Court of India
claiming the section 12(1)(a) of the Right of Children to Free and
Compulsory Education Act, 2009 violates the constitutional right of private
managements to run their institutions without governmental interference.
The parties claimed that providing 25 percent reservation for children from
economically weak section in government and private unaided schools is
unconstitutional.

            <h3>Meaning & Definition
            </h3>ICT is technology that supports activities involving information. Such
            activities include gathering, processing, storing and presenting data.
            Increasingly these activities also involve collaboration and
            communication. Hence IT has become ICT: information and
            communication technology.
            <p><strong>Opinion of Author</strong></p>



            <p class="has-text-align-justify"><em>This article aims to support those who already face barriers during their teaching and learning processes by incorporating ITC into classroom learning. The growth in the social use of ICTs and their immense impact cannot be ignored by those in the education field. In the classroom, ICT is already becoming a fundamental tool and digital literacy and culture have become scientific concepts. Teachers must have this knowledge as part of their training programme since it helps them understand technology in a more practical way by which it can be applied in a more useful way for students in the future. However, some teachers aren&#8217;t convinced that it can be beneficial to their classes.</em></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify"><em>If teachers do not know how to use ICT in their subject areas, it will be very difficult to facilitate learning in their classroom, and from my own teaching-learning experience, I believe using ICT is a successful pedagogical strategy. It is one of the greatest sources of teaching innovation, whether it is online or offline. ICT should positively affect teachers&#8217; general attitudes towards ICT in the classroom; however, it should also provide guidance on the use of ICT within each discipline. If teachers do not have this support, they often use ICT for skill-based applications that limit student academic thinking. We must ensure that educational institutions gradually implement all the technologies that might enhance student learning, and ensure that they learn to use them in a world where they are already working.</em></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify"><em>It is our right as citizens to have access to an education without fear or favour, and that is why we should all be able to enjoy it without any barriers. Apart from ICT-based teaching, I am also more focused on the syllabus, exercises, and practices as an educator. Because of this, I think that using ICT tools in every class is inappropriate. If we use the ICT tools, which are not necessary, it is very difficult to access the students&#8217; responses, and students who are smarter and catch up quickly can do more learning. Therefore, I do not think ICT tools are helpful in language classrooms as they are not effective as a science teaching, and there are some areas where traditional methods may be more effective.</em></p>
            
            
            
            <p><strong>1.1 Introduction</strong></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">Today, we live in a world dominated by information and technology (IT), where science and technology affect every aspect of our lives. In addition to allowing students with diverse learning styles to process information, organize ideas, and express learning in different ways, IT can also give them a competitive advantage in the global marketplace. Teachers should be knowledgeable about the benefits of digital literacy and be aware that children are initially taught to read, write, and count. As each generation gains more proficiency in ICT, and policy in school education aims to prepare students to actively participate in establishing, developing, maintaining.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">Building a knowledge society that supports the all-around socio-economic development of the country and enhances global competitiveness. ICT helps teachers prepare for the challenges of modern teaching-learning, and it can assist them in fulfilling their multidimensional responsibilities within various spheres of education. As a result, ICTs are very useful in developing discernment. One of the best skills students learn is how to search for information, compare it, and structure it. The idea is that ICT in education will bridge the current digital learning gap from the teacher&#8217;s point of view; however, since teachers are increasingly challenged and there is more interest in ICT in education, teachers themselves must make sure that they see the value in such technologies in the classroom.</p>
            
            
            
            <p><strong>1.2 Importance of ICT in Education</strong></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">With the use of ICT, students can think critically and creatively and can reflect on their own learning process. Furthermore, they can even set personal goals to reach their potential. Teachers use ICT as facilitators, and do not obviate the need to serve as leaders in the class, but traditional teacher leadership skills and practices should remain essential. Information and communication technologies contribute to the comfort and purpose of our lives in the same way as other technologies do.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">There is enormous potential for ICT to serve and help children&#8217;s learning processes in numerous ways. Through the application of ICT, traditional views and methods of teaching and learning can be re-envisioned. Teachers can use ICT not only to further their own education but also to accelerate the growth of their students&#8217; education by using it creatively. Through the use of ICT in education and the tools it offers, children become more engaged and show a greater willingness to learn. It&#8217;s all due to technology, and ICT tools encourage children to enhance their learning through motivation. Students are fascinated with technology, and teachers should be able to arouse their interest with fun learning and creativity to improve learning.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">The role of ICT is important for any form of education, and teachers have to adapt to all the ICT tools and improve their knowledge by providing effective information because the principle of learning is to be implemented. Providing new learning experiences to students is the main goal of any teaching-learning activity, so the teacher has to decide what learning to do, identify learning experiences, and evaluate the attainment of learning outcomes. These transactions of learning experience involve the transaction of better content, but better learning content is preparation and follow-up.</p>
                        
            <p><strong>1.3 Classification Teacher Barriers for ICT</strong></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">Teachers play a central role in the foundation of child education. Nowadays, children can access knowledge and information through television, digital media, cable network, internet and social media. ICT improves their learning in a way that is typically multidimensional in nature with a long-term learning goal. However, there are many challenges in the education sector. Teaching with ICT is a good profession, especially for those interested in helping them reach their full potential, but every educator should not discourage traditional teaching methods. It is important that teachers learn and apply their teaching strategies.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">Teaching practices are not going to change with ICT. This can allow teachers to tackle teaching, in a system of enabling conditions. ICT improves children&#8217;s learning in a way that is typically multidimensional in nature with a long-term goal. Hence, it leads to difficulties in evaluating performances in the classroom compared to classroom evaluation, which is immediate. The teacher is the core of our children&#8217;s learning. In the training programs of teachers, technology is very important to them as well. However, the use of these new possibilities in teaching also presents a challenge.</p>
            
            
            
            <ol type="1"><li>It is still not clear how many teachers put safe and fair use into their lesson planning within the ICT teaching plan?</li><li>How must teacher training programs be designed to assist teachers with safety issues and fair use?</li></ol>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">When a teacher selects materials to use in class, they should undergo a critical review process of all teaching materials. Teachers have used different categories to classify barriers to teachers&#8217; use of ICT in science classrooms. These intrinsic barriers are divided into two categories, in part because of their high teaching requirements as barriers against learning competition. Extrinsic and intrinsic differ according to their definition. As referred to, ‚Äúextrinsic‚Äù barriers are time, support, and training; and ‚Äúintrinsic‚Äù barriers are attitudes, beliefs, practices, and resistance. Whereas ‚Äúextrinsic‚Äù barriers pertain to teaching-learning organizations rather than individuals, ‚Äúintrinsic‚Äù barriers pertain to teachers, administrators, and individuals.</p>
            
            
            
            <p><strong>1.4 Pacific teaching-learning Investment Program for ICT</strong></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">The most powerful investment in our future is children&#8217;s education with the right tools and technology. It should be properly made, and education is the basis for anything and everything. It needs to reach every nook and corner. In order for information and communications technology to be successful in the classroom, education policies must be realistic, and it is also necessary to improve the quality of education and training. Through the use of ICT, educational institutions can improve the quality of education. The educational field is not just an exception. It&#8217;s a constant challenge for techies and educators to make innovative innovations and increase learning outcomes.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">The traditional classroom has changed to a modern one, and it&#8217;s also changed from a one-way to a two-way mode of learning communication. These types of things are needed because ICT is a main feature, even in pre-service teaching education, and the use of ICT is becoming main-stream in education. ICT&#8217;s influence is very important in generating change in teaching and learning, and it can change the nature of education. The roles of students and teachers in the teaching and learning process with ICT should have different disciplinary roles, which include integrating technology into traditional teaching as well as educating students in emerging technology.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">Teachers should pay more attention when preparing teaching-learning materials for use in the classroom. To maintain the sustainability of the teaching-learning programs and initiatives, the design must account for the recurrent costs. Investing in education is not just the right thing to do; it can help to build more peaceful societies. Empowering education systems combine quality and equity to produce the highest return, because children need to get a good education.</p>
            
            
            
            <p><strong>1.5 Different Strategies for applying ICT</strong></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">An individual‚Äôs child has a different learning strategy, and how he or she organizes different types uses a set of skills in order to learn content, but cognitive methods of learning is a way of learning that helps them learn more effectively, and this is an active, constructive, and long-term method of learning. These methods help students become more engaged in their learning process so that they can learn, think, and remember more effectively. </p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">Real learning always happens when students strategize their learning methods both physically and emotionally and discuss what they&#8217;ve learned to help them retain the facts. However, if teachers are digitally literate and know how to integrate ICT into these children&#8217;s learning, information and communications technology (ICT) can have a positive effect on their learning. Even ‚ÄúBloom&#8217;s Taxonomy of Learning‚Äù objectives can be broken down into three main categories of child learning. These are:</p>
            
            
            
            <ol type="1"><li>Cognitive;</li><li>Affective; and</li><li>Psycho-motor;</li></ol>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">In order to facilitate effective active learning, instruction in learning strategies needs to emphasize strategies that facilitate students&#8217; learning and the proper use of ICT to solve learning problems. At the same time, it&#8217;s crucial for any teacher to show their students exactly how to do something for their own benefit after telling them what needs to be done, and this is a crucial step in certain classes because every child&#8217;s learning domains are different processes. To achieve all of this through education, using information and communications technology (ICT), educators have to develop different strategies that can help teachers take into account the diverse learning profiles of their students and create classroom environments that foster success for all students.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">A variety of research-based instructional strategies have been recognized as effective methods of enhancing learning for students who have learning difficulties, and they can easily be incorporated into a general education classroom with the use of ICT. It is a fact that every grade level brings its own set of changes, such as curriculum, setting, expectations, and the cognitive and social development of the students. Education is one of the most important resources for students, and the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT) in education reflects and responds to today&#8217;s and tomorrow&#8217;s challenges of people functioning in a changing and intense intellectual environment. Technology is one of the factors that is changing and shaping the world very quickly.</p>
            
            
       
            
            
            <p><strong>1.6 Select appropriate ICT to teach the topic.</strong></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">As part of new literacy‚Äôs today, students are learning new technologies which are essential to becoming literate in the 21st century, and new technologies can be used to do traditional things in an appealing and exciting way. The 21st century is also the age of information and technology, and child development is the primary educational objective that early childhood educators pursue. However, some educators are struggling to keep up with new technology in classrooms, and it can be difficult for them to pinpoint the real benefits of using technology in the classroom. So, education planners have to be appropriate in choosing the right technology because there are many factors that should be considered when choosing the right technology. When selecting information technology for teaching and learning purposes, there are generally concerns with questions like</p>
            
            
            
            <ol type="1"><li>What teaching methods are going to be adopted?</li><li>What learning tasks are going to provide for learners? and&nbsp;</li><li>What characteristics are to be checked for learners?</li></ol>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">In addition to these concerns, there are other factors that contribute to ICT selection, such as the teachers&#8217; and students&#8217; attitudes toward the ICT being used in the process of teaching and learning?</p>
            
            
            
            <ol type="1"><li>What will it cost to use ICT for learning outcomes?</li><li>Are user-friendly tools being used?</li><li>Do they effectively communicate the teaching-learning content message?</li><li>Is it available for all resources as well as accessible to the teacher and students?</li></ol>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">Such things have to be taken into consideration in the selection of ICT, because the classroom is becoming more and more realistic. Technology is teetering between technological progress and instructional activities in the classroom. The key to the success of ICT is the ability to develop, teach, and provide learning with appropriate digital tools. It is true that technology is an important skill to improve any profession. The implementation of information technology in early years&#8217; education has significantly improved the development of literacy.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">It is important to inform students about the challenges faced by pre-service teachers in the 21st century. Without proper knowledge of ICT, the teacher cannot be in the classroom. Currently, education is based on child-centric teaching, so the teacher should prepare to cope with different technologies to use them in the classroom to make teaching and learning interesting. Teachers should also know what they are doing as well as how to use the equipment to teach. When a teacher decides to use ICT, the availability of technology and information technology are crucial to their success.</p>
            
            
            
            <p><strong>1.7 Challenges in using ICT in teaching and learning</strong></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">With each passing day, more and more advanced educational technology emerges. Teachers need to be able to learn how to get the most out of these new tools. There might be a number of challenges that have to be overcome in trying to integrate ICT into the teaching and learning processes. These difficulties are known as challenges, and the definition of a challenge is any condition that makes it hard to make progress or to achieve an objective. Using technology in the classroom can be very challenging and not always clear to teachers. However, these digital technologies can aid in learning as well as facilitate self-directed and collaborative teaching-learning, but many teachers are unable to access the technologies they need to enrich their students&#8217; education. They need to take into account the differences between digital and traditional classroom practices. Here are</p>

            <p class="has-text-align-justify">Without good technical support in the classroom and better resources for the whole teaching-learning process, they can&#8217;t be expected to overcome the obstacles preventing them from using ICT. Therefore, any teaching-learning activity does require the use of a particular technology for learning content purposes. To achieve teaching-learning success with ICT, a number of technological resources must be combined. However, there are many teachers who are resistant to change and have struggled to adopt educational technology. They believe that the increasing use of digital technology has created additional demands for teachers to do the right thing. However, there is no one technological solution that is appropriate for every teacher, for every course, or for every viewpoint of teaching-learning. In the eyes of many teachers, integrating technology into the classroom can be an intricate and varied process.</p>
            
            
            
            <p><strong>1.8 Implications for using ICT</strong></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">It is a widely held belief that ICT can be instrumental in empowering teachers and learners. In the most advanced schools, ICT is usually considered central to the teaching and learning process because it is one of the enduring difficulties of technology in education. However, the impact of ICT usage on student achievement remains difficult to measure but is open to debate. Achieving greater access to information and technology always provides new opportunities for any form of teaching-learning. Even though the world we live in is constantly changing, the moment someone sees something, it might not be seen again.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">The changes in our lives in the past have had a significant impact on our future, and ICT is anything that has to do with information and communication. Learning information can be in many forms, but ICT can be helpful for this learning process. The range of technologies that exist in classroom teaching-learning is huge. No matter how it&#8217;s perceived and its presence, it is important to use it to its best prospective. Although learners have modern technological requirements and children are fascinated by technology, they also enjoy learning with technology.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">To the extent education is provided by ICT, more students are able to access it. Learning can happen anywhere with the help of ICT. ICT develops students&#8217; new understanding of learning and enables them to find new solutions to different kinds of learning inquiries. It is well known that ICT improves teaching and learning. Teachers must be aware of how ICT affects their learning. If teachers are to use technology constructively to improve learning, they will achieve better outcomes for all. ICT integration can&#8217;t be implemented in isolation.</p>
            
            
            
            <p><strong>1.9 Constructivism for using ICT in Education</strong></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">Constructivism is a theory that develops the skills of others by learning to make decisions. The classroom learning environment makes children use the concept of constructive construction to enhance their learning skills. The constructivist theory of learning, which is more conceptual, also supports the idea that children learn by doing. Children construct new knowledge about their learning in which they live through playful interaction with objects and peers. According to Piaget&#8217;s theory, children learn best when they are involved in learning. Constructivism is a learning mindset with a focus on learning from the perspective of a learner‚Äôs mental construction.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">It also encourages learning activities to bring the learner back to a masterful state. A teacher can create a constructivist environment for learning, and children cannot simply be a blank slate, and knowledge cannot be imparted without their knowledge making sense, because learning and innovation are products of the transmission of knowledge. Constructivism is an important paradigm that aims to address teaching-learning problems in the context of information technology. In order to increase motivation for learning new things, the constructivist approach must involve them in the process of learning things from their cognition.</p>
            
            
            
            <p><strong>2.0 Conclusion</strong></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">Having studied all these topics, we know that maintaining the quality of education is one of the greatest challenges. At the same time, the implementation of ICT effectively in the classroom faces many challenges. With the advent of digital technology, classroom education is gradually transitioning from lecture based to a collaborative project based model. Through the ICT Policy in School Education, we intend to prepare the youth to participate creatively in the development, preservation, and growth of a knowledge society, which will lead to the all-around development of the nation and improved global competitiveness.</p>
            
            
            
            <p class="has-text-align-justify">The majority of learners in this society have distinct learning styles, so technology can differentiate instruction accordingly. For teachers to be able to evaluate and choose the most appropriate resources, they need extensive exposure to ICTs. It is considered more important to develop relevant pedagogical practices than mastery of ICTs. In schools today, ICT is used to deliver knowledge and information to students. As a result of ICT integration into the teaching-learning process, blackboards have been replaced with whiteboards, and digital smart boards have been utilized as teaching aids.</p>

        <h4>Exploring the self</h4>
    <p><h4>Defination</h4>
        Self exploration is the process to find out what is valuable to me by investigating
        within myself. What is right for me and true for me has to be judged within myself. Once we
        start paying attention towards investigating into our present beliefs and aspirations, we get to
        know whether our aspirations and what we really want to be (i.e. what is naturally acceptable
        to us) are one and the same or not. If they are the same, then it‚Äôs no problem. But if the two
        are different, it means that we are leading a life against our natural acceptance. Such a life
        cannot bring us happiness.
        Self exploration is a process of discovering that there is something innate, invariant and
        universal in all human beings. This enables us to look at the confusions and contradictions
        within us and resolve them by becoming aware of our natural acceptance.
        Once we start observing inside, we can achieve harmony at all levels of our living.
        Content of self exploration involves finding answers for the following fundamental
        questions of all the human beings:
        1. The Desire/Goal/Aspiration: What is my (human) Desire/ Goal? What do I really want in
        life, or what is the goal of human life?
        2. The Program: What is my (human) program for fulfilling my aspirations? How to fulfil
        it? What is the program to actualize the above?
        In short, the above two questions cover the whole domain of human aspirations and humanendeavor. Thus, they form the content of self- exploration.
        <h4>purpose</h4>Self exploration helps us to identify our innateness
        (Svatva) and move towards Self-Organization(Swantantrata) and Self-Expression
        (Swarajya). <br>=> It is a process of dialogue between ‚Äòwhat you are‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat you really want to be‚Äô. <br>=> It is a process of self evolution through self-investigation. <br>=> It is a process of knowing oneself and through that, knowing the entire existence.
        SCRIET MCA I Human Values and Professional Ethics
        <br>=> It is a process of recognizing one‚Äôs relationship with every unit in existence and fulfilling
        it. <br>=> It is a process of knowing human conduct, human character and living accordingly. <br>=> It is a process of being in harmony with oneself and in harmony with entire existence.

       <h4> Process of Self-Exploration</h4> <br>: The process of self exploration may initially begin as a
dialogue between two people, but eventually it becomes a dialogue within yourself. It is a
dialogue between ‚Äòwhat you are‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat you really want to be‚Äô. Self exploration enables
us to look at the confusions and contradictions within us and resolve them by becoming
aware of our natural acceptance.
The following points are to be kept in mind regarding the process of Self-Exploration: <br>=> Whatever is stated is a proposal <br>=> Don‚Äôt start by assuming it to be true or false
<br>=> Verify it on your own right
SCRIET MCA I Human Values and Professional Ethics
<br>=> Don‚Äôt just accept or reject it on the basis of scriptures, instruments or on the basis of
others. <br>
 The following two steps are involved in the process of Self-Exploration: <br>
 - Firstly, verify the proposal on the basis of your natural acceptance
 - Secondly, live according to the proposal to validate it experientially.
Natural Acceptance: It is the process of seeing and observing everything attentively and
then using your inner conscience to get the answer from within. It is a way to bring out the
goodness in everything naturally. It helps us to learn everything that is good from others and
absorb it in our own way, but without changing our identity. <br>=> It does not change with time/age
<br>=> It doesn‚Äôt depend on place
<br>=> It does not depend on our beliefs or past conditioning
<br>=> It is always there within us <br>=> It is the same for all of us.
Realization and Understanding:
The process of Self-Exploration results in ‚ÄòRealization‚Äô and ‚ÄòUnderstanding‚Äô in us. This
realization and understanding leads to the following answers ‚Äì
<br>=> Assuring
<br>=> Satisfying
<br>=> Universal with respect to Time, Space and Individual.
